# Dijkstra's Algorithm using OpenGL

“Dijkstra’s Algorithm” implemented using OpenGL. OpenGL provides a set of commands to render a three dimensional scene. That means you provide them in an OpenGL-useable form and OpenGL will show this data on the screen (render it). It is developed by many companies and it is free to use. You can develop OpenGL applications without licensing.  
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
